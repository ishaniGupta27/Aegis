About the work:  Recent works in social network stream analysis show that a user’s location can be accurately known from the topics the user writes about or engages with. To this end, we propose a mechanism to obfuscate a user’s location while publicly preserving the user’s public persona. The biggest example of the application of the proposed mechanism is preventing future incidents like Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The work can be further extended to hide other persona attributes  (an ongoing research).
